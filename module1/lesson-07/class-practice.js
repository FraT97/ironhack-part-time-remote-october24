// Add a method eatFood(food) to class Human that increases the number of calories for a human accordingly to the food's
// protein, carbs and fat properties

//      Fat provides 9 calories per gram

// Exercise 3
// Create a subclass Man from class Human, 
// it should have it's gender set to 'male' automatically

// Exercise 4
